                  Hello ma'am! Once again, Happy Teachers' Day or Month po ulit sa inyo! As the class president, naalala 'ko pa nung classroom elections, hindi 'ko po talaga inexpect that I would be chosen as the class president at medyo kinabahan po ako sa magiging resulta. Pero I got to know more about the class and you, our dear adviser. There, I knew that I was fortunately brought to a section with a warm and welcoming personality, and you were also there, a still youthful and passionate teacher who was our adviser.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Even though in busy times as a teacher, you made sure that you were always there to support us and celebrate us through your "pakains". Naalala 'ko pa how desperate were you to join in our practice sessions nung Sabayang Pagbigkas but you were busy at the faculty, and that me realized how much you cared for you advisory class. Kahit iilang months palang ang dinaan ng Einstein, there were a lot of memories that you helped us built.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Today, we wanted to gift you back the kindness and support you gave to us. Enjoy your carrot cake po, buti talaga nakita 'ko yung listahan nyo sa faculty nung isang araw HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. Also remember po that we're also here for you, to cherish and support you po in any way possible.
                </p>
                
                <div className="space-y-2 italic text-blue-600 my-6">
                  <p>We wish the best in the unfinished story of Einstein,</p>
                  <p>We wish the best for more memories with you po.</p>
